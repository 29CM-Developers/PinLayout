# Change Log
## [1.3.0](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.3.0)
Released on 2017-08-18. 

#### Change
* **Breaking change related to hCenter(CGFloat), hCenter(percent), vCenter(CGFloat), vCenter(percent)**:  
  * **`vCenter(_ value: CGFloat)`** and **`vCenter(_ percent: Percent)`**:  
The value specifies the distance vertically of the view's center **related to the superview's center** in pixels. Previously it was related to the **superview's top edge**.
  * **`hCenter(_ value: CGFloat)`** and **`hCenter(_ percent: Percent)`**:  
The value specifies the distance horizontally of the view's center **related to the superview's center** in pixels. Previously it was related to the **superview's left edge**.

Previously `hCenter(0)` wasn't equal to `hCenter()`, same thing for `vCenter(0)`. But this was an exception: `top(0)` == `top()`,` left(0)` == `left()`, `right(0)` == `right()`. Now thay all have the same logic.

## [1.2.4](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.2.4)
#### Change
* Add methods to pin hCenter and vCenter to any other view's edges (including the new hCenter and vCenter edges)
	*  **New methods**:
		* **`hCenter(to: edge)`**  
        Position horizontally the view's center directly on another viewâ€™s edge (left/hCenter/right)
		* **`vCenter(to: edge)`**  
        Position vertically the view's center directly on another viewâ€™s edge (top/vCenter/bottom).
	*  **New UIView's edges**:
		*  **`UIView.edge.hCenter`**
		*  **`UIView.edge.vCenter`**
	* Added by [Luc Dion](https://github.com/lucdion) in Pull Request [#80](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/pull/80) 
  
## [1.2.3](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.2.3)
#### Change
* Warnings now display more context information
  * The class name of the view being layouted.
  * The view's current frame 
  * The class name of all superviews
  * The view's Tag  

	Examples:
	
	* ðŸ‘‰ PinLayout Warning: width(50.0%) won't be applied, the view (UIView) must be added as a sub-view before being layouted using this method.  
(Layouted view info: Type: UIView, Frame: (10.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0), Tag: 0)
	
	* ðŸ‘‰ PinLayout Warning: width(-20.0) won't be applied, the width (-20.0) must be greater than or equal to zero.  
(Layouted view info: Type: ItemButton, Frame: (140.0, 100.0, 100.0, 60.0), Superviews: HomeView -> UIView, Tag: 0)
	
	* ðŸ‘‰ PinLayout Warning: topLeft(to: .topLeft, of: (UIView, Frame: (10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0))) won't be applied, the reference view (UIView, Frame: (10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0)) must be added as a sub-view before being used as a reference.  
(Layouted view info: Type: UIView, Frame: (140.0, 100.0, 100.0, 60.0), Superviews: UIView -> UIView, Tag: 0)

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.2.2)
#### Change
* Added a new method `fitSize()` that will replace the `sizeThatFit()` method. Its prior name was creating confusion with the already existingUIView.sizeToFit()` method.
* `sizeThatFit()` method has been marked as deprecated.

#### Change
* Add Swift 4.0 support

  * before(of: UIView, aligned: VerticalAlign), before(of: [UIView], aligned: VerticalAlign)
  * after(of: UIView), after(of: [UIView])
  * after(of: UIView, aligned: VerticalAlign), after(of: [UIView], aligned: VerticalAlign)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.1.0)
Released on 2017-06-18. 

#### Change
* Update relative methods signatures when specifying multiple relative views.  
Update the minor version due to a small breaking change with methods above(ofâ€¦), below(ofâ€¦), left(ofâ€¦) and right(ofâ€¦). They now takes either a single UIView or an Array of UIViews.
  * Added by [Luc Dion](https://github.com/lucdion) in Pull Request [#48](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/pull/48)

#### Change
* Add **tvOS** support & set iOS target to 8.0 (instead of 10.2)
  * Added by [Luc Dion](https://github.com/lucdion) in Pull Request [#46](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/pull/46)


## [1.0.14](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.0.14)
Released on 2017-06-12. 

#### Change

* Implementation of **relative positioning using multiple relative views**
  * Added by [Luc Dion](https://github.com/lucdion) in Pull Request [#43](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/pull/43)
  * The following methods can now receives one or many relative views. Useful to position a view relative to many UIViews.  
	 * `above(of relativeViews: UIView...) `
	 * `above(of relativeViews: UIView..., aligned: HorizontalAlignment) `
	 * `below(of relativeViews: UIView...)`
	 * `below(of relativeViews: UIView..., aligned: HorizontalAlignment)`
	 * `left(of relativeViews: UIView...) `
	 * `left(of relativeViews: UIView..., aligned: VerticalAlignment)`
	 * `right(of relativeViews: UIView...) `
	 * `right(of relativeViews: UIView..., aligned: VerticalAlignment)`

## [1.0.11](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/releases/tag/1.0.11)
Released on 2017-06-08. 

#### Change

* Add **Swift Package Manager** support
  * Added by [Luc Dion](https://github.com/lucdion) in Pull Request [#38](https://github.com/mirego/PinLayout/pull/38
* **`size(â€¦)` methods** now tries to apply the width and the height individually  
Previously the size specified was applied only if both the width and height wasnâ€™t specified. Now PinLayout will apply them individually, so if the width has been specified yet, the sizeâ€™s width will be applied, else a warning will be displayed that indicate that the width wonâ€™t be applied. Same thing for the height.
* Doesnâ€™t display a warning anymore if the new specified width or height value is equal to the currently set value. This is coherent with other methods (top, left, hCenter, â€¦.)
* Clean up `size(...)` methods source code
* Add PinLayout's performance documentation
* Add 52 more unit tests. Code coverage is now 95.38%.
